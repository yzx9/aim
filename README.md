AIM is your intelligent assistant for managing time and tasks.
It **analyzes** your schedule using AI-driven insights,
**interacts** naturally to understand your needs and preferences,
and enables you to **manage** your time with clarity, control, and confidence.

Built on the [iCalendar standard (RFC 5545)](https://icalendar.org/RFC-Specifications/iCalendar-RFC-5545/) and compatible with [CalDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV) servers like [Radicale](https://radicale.org/), AIM ensures interoperability and flexibility across systems.
From smart reminders to personalized insights, AIM helps you work smarter, not harder.
