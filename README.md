AIM is your intelligent assistant for managing time and tasks.
It **analyzes** your schedule using AI-driven insights,
**interacts** naturally to understand your needs and preferences,
and enables you to **manage** your time with clarity, control, and confidence.

Built on the [iCalendar standard (RFC 5545)](https://icalendar.org/RFC-Specifications/iCalendar-RFC-5545/) and compatible with [CalDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV) servers like [Radicale](https://radicale.org/), AIM ensures interoperability and flexibility across systems.
From smart reminders to personalized insights, AIM helps you work smarter, not harder.

## Usage

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run with Cargo

To run the CLI using Cargo:

```sh
cargo install aimcal
aim --help
```

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Run with Nix

```sh
nix run . -- --help
```

## Goals

- **Enable command-line calendar management**: Perform queries and manage events and todos directly from the CLI.
- **Leverage LLMs for intelligent assistance**: Offer smart scheduling and reminder suggestions tailored to user preferences.
- **Integrate with external systems**: Support CalDAV providers and expose Webhook/REST APIs for triggers and calendar access.
